# Error 1: "Environment can't be set"

>400 Bad Request - Field 'environment' cannot be set. It is not on the appropriate screen, or unknown.

This error arrises when the **Environment** field is unavailable as an option
for JIRA issue creation.
The fix is to add the **Environment** field on your JIRA issue screen. These
next steps will help you add the **Environment field**.

## Steps

### 1. Click **Administration** in the top right corner and select **Issues**

![jira issues cog dropdown](/docs/assets/img/docs/integrations/jira_issues_cog_dropdown.png)

### 2. Select **Screens**

![jira issues admin dropdown](/docs/assets/img/docs/integrations/jira_issues_admin_dropdown.png)

### 3. In **Default Screen** under the **Operations** column click **Configure**
*Note: if you have changed your default screen, make sure to find the screen
that applies to your project.*

### 4. Scroll to find the drop down menu and select **Environment**

# Error 2: "Labels can't be set"

>400 Bad Request - Field 'labels' cannot be set. It is not on the appropriate screen, or unknown.

The solution for this error is nearly identical to the previous **Environment
can't be set** error except for one variation. The goal is to add a **Labels**
field on your JIRA issue screen. Follow the **Environment can't be set**
instructions above, but instead of adding **Environment** select **Labels**
from the dropdown menu.

If you are still experiencing this issue after adding **Labels** to your JIRA
issue screen. This can be caused by created a custom created field named
**Labels** instead of adding the default one provided by JIRA.
Please make sure to add the default **Labels** field.

# Error 3: "Summary can't be set"

>400 Bad Request - Field 'summary' cannot be set. It is not on the appropriate screen, or unknown.

The solution for this error is again identical to the **Environment can't be set**
and **Labels can't be set** errors. Follow the **Environment can't be set**
instructions above, but instead of adding **Environment** select **Summary**
from the dropdown menu.

Still seeing this error after following the steps above? If you use **Atlassian
single sign on** to authenticate, make sure to complete the reauthetication
process otherwise Airbrake will not have the access needed for the integration
to work.

# Error 4: Invalid issue type

>400 Bad Request - The issue type selected is invalid.

This error is often the result of your JIRA project not supporting the
**Bug** issue type.
The solution is to [create the **Bug** issue
type](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/defining-issue-type-field-values-185729517.html)
for your existing project, or create a new JIRA project that supports the
**Bug** issue type.

# Error 5: Unauthorized

>401 Unauthorized - Please make sure the credentials are correct and try again.

This is often caused by using an email address instead of your JIRA username in
the **username** field.  Please verify that you are using your JIRA username.
You can find your JIRA username in your profile page by clicking your avatar in
JIRA.

### Correct: specifies the username

# Error 6: Field is required

>Error: 400 Bad Request - `field_name` is required. Airbrake does not support required field. Please use the default field settings on your Jira account.

This error occurs when your JIRA setup requires a field that Airbrake is not set
up to provide. Please make the field that is mentioned in the error message
optional in your JIRA settings, then test the integration again.

# Error 7: Moved permanently

>Jira integration could not connect. Error: 301 Moved Permanently - Please make sure the credentials are correct and try again.

If you're seeing this error with **onDemand** JIRA but have double checked that
you're using the correct credentials, then please check that you're using
`https` instead of `http` for the **Server URL** field.
