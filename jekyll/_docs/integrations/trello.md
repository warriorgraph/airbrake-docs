Create Trello cards for new Airbrake errors!
This integration allows you to create a Trello card from an Airbrake error manually.
You can also set this integration to automatically create a Trello card when a new type of error is reported to Airbrake.

## Authenticate with Trello
Airbrake needs permission to create Trello cards for your project.
Click **Integrations** in the menu bar for your project's dashboard. Then click **Trello**
on the left side of the screen. Click the button that says **Authorize with Trello**.
