# Reasons for error rejections

## 1. Minimum app version filtering
If you have a [minimum app version](/docs/features/app-versions/) set, and you
send errors that are below that version or have no version set, then they will
be rejected. This is helpful if you are only concerned with errors from your
application's latest version.

## 2. Invalid format
The error notice is rejected if it is sent with incorrect JSON/XML as determined
by:

- **JSON:** [POST data schema](https://airbrake.io/docs/api/#post-data-schema-v3) and
[POST data fields](https:/airbrake.io/docs/api/#post-data-fields-v3)
- **XML**: as described in our [XML API doc](/docs/api-2/notifier-api-v23)

## Graphed rejections
You can view rejected error trends in your project overview graph.

## Getting rejections?

Rejections are less likely with official and widely adopted Airbrake notifiers.
However, if errors sent by your Notifier are consistently getting rejected,
please help improve the Airbrake notifier you are using by creating a GitHub
issue for the notifier and reporting the problem to support@airbrake.io.
