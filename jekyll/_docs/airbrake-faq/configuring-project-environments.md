You can configure environments in your Airbrake project for organizing your
project's errors.  Each project can have as many environments as you like.
Some examples of commonly used environments are `production`, `staging`,
`development`, and `test`.

## Setting your environments
Setting your environments is done in your notifier configuration.  The setup is
different for each notifier so check your notifier's readme on GitHub.
