## Is data encrypted at rest?
All Airbrake customer data is stored encrypted at rest. This includes backups.

## Where is Airbrake hosted?
Airbrake is hosted on Amazon Web Services in facilities which maintain
various levels of compliance, certifications and assurance. More information
can be found on the [AWS security pages](https://aws.amazon.com/security/) or [requested from AWS](https://pages.awscloud.com/compliance-contact-us.html).

## Does Airbrake have two-factor authentication?
Two-factor authentication is available for all paid plans and can be enabled on
your [profile page](https://airbrake.io/users/edit). For more info on how to set
up the two-factor authentication, please visit the
[two-factor authentication doc](/docs/features/two-factor-authentication).

Airbrake also supports the two-factor authentication as part of the GitHub
single sign-on feature. By enabling the two-factor authentication on your GitHub
profile you help secure your Airbrake account with an extra layer of security.
