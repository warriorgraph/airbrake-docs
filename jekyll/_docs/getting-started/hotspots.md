### What are Hotspots

Hotspots give you a deeper view into your errors, identify common patterns, and
deliver the insights you need to quickly prioritize problem areas based on
your unique needs.

### Hotspots: Understanding trends across all your errors

Hotspots show you where errors are concentrated so you can focus on the problems
that matter most. Just a few potential use cases:

**What files cause the most errors?** Dive into your most error prone files so you
can knock out a bunch of bugs.

**What pages are most affected by errors?** Identify and fix errors on critical
conversion web pages before they impact your metrics.

**What error messages keep popping up?** Determine your most common errors so you
can work to educate your team on how to avoid them.

Find out who exactly hits bugs with your app and why.

view.

You'll notice that each list entry has a colored dot next to it - red, orange or blue.
These give you an idea of which errors are occurring more often. The number next to
the dot is the number of errors that are associate with that particular list entry.
If you click on the list entry you will see the errors in the search results to the
left.
