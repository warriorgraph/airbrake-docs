## Using our API

Integrate any application or build custom notifiers using Airbrake's public
[APIs](https://airbrake.io/docs/api/)

## Third party and community notifiers

Airbrake has many community maintained notifers for capturing exceptions in
your applications. We also offer a couple of addons/plugins with 3rd parties.
Below is a list of our favorites:

- [Airbrake Cyrstal](https://github.com/kyrylo/airbrake-crystal)
- [Airbrake Rust](https://github.com/kyrylo/airbrake-rust)
- [Airbrake Elixir](https://github.com/fazibear/airbrakex)
- [New Relic Agent](http://newrelic.com/plugins/ironio/105)
- [Errbit](https://github.com/errbit/errbit)
- [Erlang](https://github.com/kenpratt/erlbrake)
- [Chef](https://github.com/cgriego/chef-airbrake_handler)
