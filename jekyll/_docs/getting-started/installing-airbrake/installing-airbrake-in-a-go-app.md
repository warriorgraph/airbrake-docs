### Features
* Notify Airbrake on panics
* Ignore errors based on class, message, status, file, or any other filter
* [Send errors from glog to Airbrake](https://github.com/airbrake/glog)
* Add extra context to errors before reporting them
* Set error severity to control notification thresholds

### Example usage

To include Airbrake in your Go application you'll need to import the Gobrake
code, available at
[https://github.com/airbrake/gobrake](https://github.com/airbrake/gobrake). To
configure the Go notifier you will need your `PROJECT ID` and `PROJECT API KEY` available
from your project's settings page.

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"

	"gopkg.in/airbrake/gobrake.v2"
)

var airbrake = gobrake.NewNotifier(<Your project ID>, "<Your project API KEY>")

func init() {
	airbrake.AddFilter(func(notice *gobrake.Notice) *gobrake.Notice {
		notice.Context["environment"] = "production"
		return notice
	})
}

func main() {
	defer airbrake.Close()
	defer airbrake.NotifyOnPanic()

	airbrake.Notify(errors.New("operation failed"), nil)
}
```
