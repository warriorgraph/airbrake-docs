# Deploy Tracking is not resolving errors for your environment?

### Reason 1: Environment name does not match exactly

Deploy tracking environment names are case sensitive. Therefore `Production`
and `production` would be treated as different environments. Ensure that the
`environment` string you specify for your deploys is an exact match of the
`environment` string of your errors.

If you are using the [airbrake Ruby gem](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake),
you may want to check that `RAILS_ENV` is identical to the `environment`
variable you initialized your notifier with.

### Reason 2: **Resolve all errors after a deploy** is unchecked

The **Resolve all errors after a deploy** setting is enabled by default, but it
can be disabled. It can be found on your project's settings page.

# Errors are not associated with deploys, and vice-versa

Deploys are considered 'active' until a new deploy to the same environment
(e.g. 'production') replaces it. Airbrake associates new errors to the active
deploy of the same environment.

_If_ you use the optional [App Version](/docs/features/app-versions) Airbrake
feature, Airbrake will only associate errors and deploys that have a matching
`version` string, in addition to a matching `environment`.

Therefore, common solutions to errors and deploys not being associated are:

- Ensure that the `environment` string is identical on the errors and the
  deploys.
- If you _do not_ wish to use the [App Version](/docs/features/app-versions)
  behavior, do not specify `version` with your errors or deploys.
- If you _do_ wish to use the [App Version](/docs/features/app-versions)
  behavior, ensure the `version` of your errors and deploys are consistent.

# Capistrano Deploys
If the notification of the deploy is not happening automatically when you do a
capistrano deploy, you may need to add `require 'airbrake/capistrano'` to your
`deploy.rb`. Refer to the [airbrake Ruby gem docs](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake#capistrano)
for usage.
