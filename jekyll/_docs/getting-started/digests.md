Digest emails provide a summary of what happened on your account, including new
errors, occurrences & deploys across all projects you are subscribed to. The
summary contains trends to help you understand how your projects are performing.

For example, the following digest shows a 250% increase of errors during one day
in 88 projects an account has (7 errors yesterday vs 2 errors 2 days ago):

![digest email](/docs/assets/img/docs/features/digest.png)

The information is emailed to you in stated intervals (currently, we support
only the daily interval).

To unsubscribe from daily digests, click the "Unsubscribe" link and follow the
instructions:

![digest emails unsubscribe](/docs/assets/img/docs/features/digest_unsubscribe.png)

Alternatively, you can configure the ["Send digest emails"
setting](/docs/features/digests/#managing-email-subscriptions) in
your [profile notifications](https://airbrake.io/users/notifications):

![digest emails option](/docs/assets/img/docs/features/digest_settings.png)

Digest emails collect information based on your project subscriptions. For
example, if your account has 3 projects and you are subscribed only to 2 of
them, then your digest won't be taking into account the 3rd project that you
don't belong to. You can manage your project subscriptions at the ["Edit
projects" page](https://airbrake.io/users/projects).
