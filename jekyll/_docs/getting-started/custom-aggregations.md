## What are Aggregations?

<img width="500px" src="/docs/assets/img/docs/features/aggregations.png" alt="Aggregations view">

Aggregations show you all sorts of useful info across all the occurrences of
an error group. If the data is present, Airbrake will automatically show you a
breakdown of these segments of each error group:

- Error messages
- Server hostnames
- Remote addresses and countries
- Components and actions
- Affected users, user IP addresses, IP countries
- Browsers, browser engines, and browser platforms
- Filenames
- Functions
- App versions
- URLs

You can view an error's Aggregations by clicking the "Aggregations" tab to the
right of the "Occurrences" tab. Note: the Aggregations tab is only available
when there's more than one occurrence of an error.

Aggregations are available on [all paid plans](https://airbrake.io/pricing).

## Custom Aggregations

Along with the automatic Aggregations Airbrake makes for you, you can add any
error parameter to be aggregated. To do this, just select the parameter you
want from the drop down menu in the "More aggregations" section of the
Aggregations tab.

Custom Aggregations are available on the [Business plan and above](https://airbrake.io/account/plan/edit).

### Add a custom aggregation to project wide search

Adding an aggregation to project wide search means that you can now search and
filter all errors in your project by this parameter. For more information on
this, please visit our
[Search and Filtering](https://airbrake.io/docs/airbrake-faq/how-do-i-use-search-and-filtering/#filtering-by-custom-attributes)
doc.
